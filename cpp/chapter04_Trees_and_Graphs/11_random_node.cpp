// Problem
// You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch witch, in addition to insert, find and delete, has a method getRandomNode() wich returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for get RandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
