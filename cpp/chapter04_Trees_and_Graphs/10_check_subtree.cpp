// Problem
// T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.
// A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n id identical to T2. that is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
