// Problem
// You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to given value. Tha path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
