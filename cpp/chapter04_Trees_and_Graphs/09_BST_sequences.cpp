// Problem
// A binary search tree was created by travering through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.
// EXAMPLE
// INPUT:
//                     (2)
//                    /   \
//                  (1)   (3)
// OUTPUT:
// {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}
