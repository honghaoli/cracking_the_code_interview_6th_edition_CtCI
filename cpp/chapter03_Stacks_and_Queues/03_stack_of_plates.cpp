// Problem
// Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and pop() should behave identically to a single stack.
// FOLLOW UP
// Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
